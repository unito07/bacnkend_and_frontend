## Brief overview
- Guidelines for tracking progress on tasks and communicating completion of steps.

## Development workflow
- After completing each step in a multi-step plan, report back and explicitly mark the step as done.


## steps
Phase 1: Setup UI Libraries and Tailwind CSS

[x] Install Tailwind CSS:
    [x] Install tailwindcss, postcss, and autoprefixer in the front-end-react/ directory.
    [x] Initialize Tailwind CSS to generate tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js.
    [x] Configure tailwind.config.js to include paths to all React component files (.jsx, .js, .tsx, .ts) so Tailwind can scan them for classes.
    [x] Add the Tailwind directives (@tailwind base;, @tailwind components;, @tailwind utilities;) to front-end-react/src/index.css.
[x] Integrate ShadCN UI:
    [x] Install ShadCN UI dependencies (typically npx shadcn-ui@latest init in front-end-react/).
    [x] Add core UI elements (e.g., Button, Input, Form components) using npx shadcn-ui@latest add <component-name>.
[ ] Integrate Magic UI:
    [ ] Magic UI is an MCP server. Its components will be leveraged via MCP tools when needed for the Landing Page and marketing sections.


Phase 2: Implement Routing and Page Structure
[x] Install React Router DOM:
    [x] Install react-router-dom in front-end-react/.
[x] Create Page Components:
[x] Create new .jsx files under front-end-react/src/pages/ (or a similar structure) for each main route:
[x] LandingPage.jsx (for the homepage /)
[x] ScraperPage.jsx (for the main tool /app)
[x] AboutUsPage.jsx (for /about)
[x] DocumentationPage.jsx (for /docs)
[x] HistoryLogsPage.jsx (placeholder for /history)
[x] SettingsPage.jsx (placeholder for /settings)
[x] Update App.jsx:
[x] Configure react-router-dom to define the routes for each of these new pages.
[x] Move the existing StaticScraper and DynamicScraper components into ScraperPage.jsx.


Phase 3: UI Implementation (Iterative)
[ ] Landing Page (LandingPage.jsx):
[ ] Design the Hero Section with the specified title, subtitle, and CTA button.
[ ] Add sections for Features Summary and "How It Works" (1-2-3 layout).
[ ] Utilize Magic UI components for visual appeal and animations.
[ ] Scraper Page (ScraperPage.jsx):
[ ] Integrate the existing StaticScraper and DynamicScraper components.
[ ] Refine their UI elements (buttons, input fields, forms) using ShadCN UI components.
[ ] Ensure the JSON result preview and download/export buttons are well-integrated and styled.
[ ] About Us Page (AboutUsPage.jsx):
[ ] Implement sections for the "Why we built this" story, team info, GitHub link, and contact details.
[ ] Documentation Page (DocumentationPage.jsx):
[ ] Create basic content for static/dynamic scraping guides, CSS selectors, and troubleshooting, styled with Tailwind CSS.
[ ] Styling:
[ ] Apply Tailwind CSS classes consistently across all new and existing components.
