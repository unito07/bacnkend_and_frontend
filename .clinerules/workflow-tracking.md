## Brief overview
- Guidelines for tracking progress on tasks and communicating completion of steps.

## Development workflow
- After completing each step in a multi-step plan, report back and explicitly mark the step as done.


## steps
Phase 1: Setup UI Libraries and Tailwind CSS

[ ] Install Tailwind CSS:
[ ] Install tailwindcss, postcss, and autoprefixer in the front-end-react/ directory.
[ ] Initialize Tailwind CSS to generate tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js.
[ ] Configure tailwind.config.js to include paths to all React component files (.jsx, .js, .tsx, .ts) so Tailwind can scan them for classes.
[ ] Add the Tailwind directives (@tailwind base;, @tailwind components;, @tailwind utilities;) to front-end-react/src/index.css.
[ ] Integrate ShadCN UI:
[ ] Install ShadCN UI dependencies (typically npx shadcn-ui@latest init in front-end-react/).
[ ] Add core UI elements (e.g., Button, Input, Form components) using npx shadcn-ui@latest add <component-name>.
[ ] Integrate Magic UI:
[ ] Install Magic UI dependencies (e.g., npm install magicui).
[ ] Prepare for using Magic UI components primarily for the Landing Page and marketing sections.


Phase 2: Implement Routing and Page Structure
[ ] Install React Router DOM:
[ ] Install react-router-dom in front-end-react/.
[ ] Create Page Components:
[ ] Create new .jsx files under front-end-react/src/pages/ (or a similar structure) for each main route:
[ ] LandingPage.jsx (for the homepage /)
[ ] ScraperPage.jsx (for the main tool /app)
[ ] AboutUsPage.jsx (for /about)
[ ] DocumentationPage.jsx (for /docs)
[ ] HistoryLogsPage.jsx (placeholder for /history)
[ ] SettingsPage.jsx (placeholder for /settings)
[ ] Update App.jsx:
[ ] Configure react-router-dom to define the routes for each of these new pages.
[ ] Move the existing StaticScraper and DynamicScraper components into ScraperPage.jsx.


Phase 3: UI Implementation (Iterative)
[ ] Landing Page (LandingPage.jsx):
[ ] Design the Hero Section with the specified title, subtitle, and CTA button.
[ ] Add sections for Features Summary and "How It Works" (1-2-3 layout).
[ ] Utilize Magic UI components for visual appeal and animations.
[ ] Scraper Page (ScraperPage.jsx):
[ ] Integrate the existing StaticScraper and DynamicScraper components.
[ ] Refine their UI elements (buttons, input fields, forms) using ShadCN UI components.
[ ] Ensure the JSON result preview and download/export buttons are well-integrated and styled.
[ ] About Us Page (AboutUsPage.jsx):
[ ] Implement sections for the "Why we built this" story, team info, GitHub link, and contact details.
[ ] Documentation Page (DocumentationPage.jsx):
[ ] Create basic content for static/dynamic scraping guides, CSS selectors, and troubleshooting, styled with Tailwind CSS.
[ ] Styling:
[ ] Apply Tailwind CSS classes consistently across all new and existing components.
