## Brief overview
This Cline rule file outlines preferences for developing the web scraper project, including communication style, development workflow, coding best practices, and project context.

## Communication style
- Be concise and to the point in all communications.
- Avoid unnecessary details or explanations.

## Development workflow
- Focus on iterative development, with frequent testing and feedback.
- Prioritize clear and well-defined tasks.

## Coding best practices
- Use clear and descriptive variable and function names.
- Follow established coding conventions for the project.
- Write well-documented code.

## Project context
- The project involves creating a web scraper with a new UI and connecting it to existing code.
- The tech stack includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Other guidelines
- Use hyphens ("-") instead of underscores ("\_") to separate words in filenames.
- When creating the backend, use FastAPI to create API endpoints. You can either create new functions or use pre-made ones and wrap them in an API endpoint.
