## Brief overview
This document outlines the policy regarding code modifications for the current task or project.

## Code Modification
- **No Code Changes**: Unless explicitly instructed otherwise for a specific task, no lines of code in existing files should be altered or modified.
- **Review and Analysis Only**: The primary interaction with the codebase should be for review, understanding, and analysis, not for making edits.
- **New File Creation**: If new functionality is required, it should ideally be implemented in new files, preserving the integrity of existing code, unless direct modification is explicitly requested.
