## Brief overview
- This rule outlines the workflow for tracking UI improvements and ensuring consistent styling.

## Development workflow
- For UI improvements, a checklist will be maintained within the relevant task context.
- Each UI improvement task will be broken down into smaller, actionable steps.
- Upon completion of each step, it will be explicitly marked with `[x]`.

## UI/UX preferences
- The goal is to achieve a modern and sleek aesthetic for the UI.
- Prioritize the use of ShadCN UI components for consistency and visual appeal.
- Apply Tailwind CSS classes for styling, ensuring responsiveness and a clean design.
- Avoid using Magic UI components due to current API key/limit issues.
